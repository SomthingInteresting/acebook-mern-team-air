//findOne() and save() methods used in the code are asynchronous operations that involve interacting with a database, which may take some time to complete. 
//findOne() and save() are both asynchronous operations that return Promises in Mongoose. 
// When using asynchronous operations, it's best to use async/await or .then() to handle the Promises and ensure that the code executes in the correct order and ensures the application remains responsive and performs efficiently.
// on its own the save() method takes a callback function that will be executed once the operation is completed.  




// const { email } = req.body; is using object destructuring to extract the email property from the req.body object. 
//This means that it's equivalent to writing const email = req.body.email;, but in a shorter and more concise way.

//On the other hand, const user = new User(req.body); is creating a new instance of the User model and passing the entire req.body object as an argument
